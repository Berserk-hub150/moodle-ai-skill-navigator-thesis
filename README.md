AI Skill Navigator is an AI-powered Moodle local plugin developed as a thesis prototype for AI-supported learning inside a university LMS.

It adds tutoring, course-material-grounded assistance, quiz generation, mind map generation, XR scenario generation and teacher-oriented analytics to Moodle.

> Academic prototype focused on Generative AI, RAG, Digital Twin, Virtual Worlds and educational technology.

## Highlights

- AI Tutor for open learning questions.
- Course AI Tutor grounded on teacher materials.
- Quiz Generator for formative micro-tests.
- Mind Map Generator for concept visualisation.
- XR Scenario Generator for Virtual Worlds learning activities.
- Teacher Materials area for course knowledge management.
- Student dashboard with learning progress indicators.
- Teacher dashboard with weak-topic overview.
- RAG-oriented support for selected course materials.

## Demo flow

1. Open the AI Skill Navigator dashboard.
2. Ask a question to the AI Tutor.
3. Generate a quiz from a topic or teacher materials.
4. Generate a mind map.
5. Generate an XR scenario.
6. Explain the architecture: Strategy, Factory Method and Facade.

## Thesis context

The project explores how generative AI can support digital learning in Moodle, with a focus on personalised learning, AI-assisted formative assessment, course-material-grounded tutoring, digital skills training and extensibility toward Virtual Worlds.

The plugin is intended as an academic thesis prototype, not as a production-ready commercial Moodle extension.

## Architecture

The plugin is organised around Moodle pages and service classes.

The refactored AI layer contains:

- AI provider strategies;
- a provider factory;
- a prompt builder;
- a workflow facade;
- backward-compatible Moodle page integrations.

## Design patterns

### Strategy

The AI provider logic is abstracted through a common interface.

Implemented strategies:

- Ollama provider;
- OpenAI-compatible provider;
- prototype/demo provider.

### Factory Method

The provider factory creates the correct AI provider based on Moodle plugin settings.

### Facade

The AI workflow facade exposes high-level operations such as asking the tutor, generating quizzes, generating mind maps, generating XR scenarios and summarising materials.

## SOLID principles

| Principle | Application |
|---|---|
| Single Responsibility | Provider calls, prompt construction and workflow orchestration are separated. |
| Open/Closed | New AI providers can be added by implementing the provider interface. |
| Liskov Substitution | Provider implementations can be used interchangeably through the same contract. |
| Interface Segregation | Pages depend on a small text-generation interface instead of concrete API classes. |
| Dependency Inversion | High-level workflows depend on abstractions rather than concrete provider classes. |

## Software quality attributes

| Quality attribute | Improvement |
|---|---|
| Maintainability | Smaller service classes and clearer responsibilities. |
| Reusability | AI services are reused by tutor, quiz, mind map and XR modules. |
| Portability | Provider, endpoint and model are configurable. |
| Robustness | Prototype mode keeps the demo usable without an external AI service. |
| Verifiability | PHP files can be linted and tested independently. |
| Comprehensibility | Documentation explains the role of each component. |
| Interoperability | The plugin remains integrated with Moodle courses and pages. |

## Local development

Start Moodle:

```powershell
cd $env:USERPROFILE\Desktop\TESI-MOODLE
docker compose up -d
```

Deploy plugin changes:

```powershell
.\plugins\aiskillnavigator\scripts\deploy-plugin.ps1
```

Run PHP lint checks:

```powershell
.\plugins\aiskillnavigator\scripts\lint-plugin.ps1
```

## Main plugin pages

```text
http://localhost:8080/local/aiskillnavigator/index.php
http://localhost:8080/local/aiskillnavigator/tutor.php?courseid=1
http://localhost:8080/local/aiskillnavigator/quizgenerator.php?courseid=1
http://localhost:8080/local/aiskillnavigator/mindmapgenerator.php?courseid=1
http://localhost:8080/local/aiskillnavigator/scenariogenerator.php?courseid=1
```

## AI provider configuration

Supported provider names include:

- `deepseek`;
- `openai`;
- `openai_compatible`;
- `openrouter`;
- `ollama`;
- `prototype`;
- `mock`;
- `demo`.

Current demo configuration:

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Provider | `deepseek` |
| Endpoint | DeepSeek API endpoint configured in Moodle settings |
| Model | DeepSeek chat model configured in Moodle settings |

The plugin does not store API keys in the repository. Provider credentials must be configured through Moodle/plugin settings or local environment configuration.

## Roadmap

- Add real screenshot gallery.
- Add a short demo GIF.
- Improve PDF material extraction.
- Add JSON schema validation for XR blueprints.
- Improve quiz difficulty calibration.
- Add bilingual Italian/English UI strings.
- Add automated tests for provider factory and prompt builder.

## Status

This repository contains an academic thesis prototype focused on feasibility, architecture, extensibility and software quality improvements.
